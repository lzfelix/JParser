# Parselex
For a long time I have been promising to myself that I would write a math parser. Well, now it is going on.
I am developing this as a self-challenge, so I am not basing this on any other source, just my previous experiences with parser while I try to improve my OO skills. So yes, it may be better ways to do what I've done.

The only thing that I really consulted was Dijkstra's Shunting-yard Algorithm.

# Improvments
Add suport to n-dimensional variables;
Improve the complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).
